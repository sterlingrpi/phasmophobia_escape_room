An escape room inspried by the hit video game, Phasmophobia. Intended to be a real life version of Phasmophobia video game, This code interfaces with hardware to simulate interactions and evidence (ie, voice recognition, camera object detection, RF outlet switches, and much much more!). The camera object detection model will detect if players are not hiding.

A FM transmitter is able to play sounds over the SB7-T spirit box. Voice recognition understands the player's voice. The object detection knows whether the player is in frame. Notice how the ghost response ont the spirit box changes when I move away.

FM transmitter connected to an Arduino controls the radio controlled outlets. On voice recognition the ghost blinks the light.
